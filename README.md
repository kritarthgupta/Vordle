ðŸŸ¢ Vordle â€” A BioTwin in the Making of Wordle
Vordle is a sleek, minimalist clone of the iconic Wordle game â€” a true biotwin in the making. Designed to capture the original experience with a personalized twist, Vordle challenges players to guess a hidden 5-letter word in 6 attempts using visual color-coded feedback for correctness:

â€¢ ðŸŸ© Green for correct letter in the correct spot

â€¢ ðŸŸ¨ Yellow for correct letter in the wrong spot

â€¢ â¬› Gray for incorrect letters

Built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries!), it includes:

â€¢ Flip animations for letter tiles

â€¢ An on-screen and physical keyboard interface

â€¢ Validations for incomplete guesses

â€¢ Clean and intuitive UI inspired by Wordle

Whether you're trying to build your own word game or just exploring how Wordle works under the hood, Vordle is a fun and functional starting point â€” and a growing biotwin of one of the internet's most loved games.
